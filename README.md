# Downstragram

## About

Downstagram is a simple command line tool to download and backup all your [Instagram][0] photos.

## Install

    npm install -g downstagram

## Configure

After installation, Downstagram creates a configuration file in your home directory:

    ~/.downstagram

The file has the following fields and structure:

    {
        "auth": {
            "client_id": "INSERT_HERE",
            "client_secret": "INSERT_HERE",
            "access_token": "INSERT_HERE"
        }
    }

You must change this files with your own values or Downstagram won't work.

### How do I get these values?

To get the values asked in the config file, you need to go to the [Instagram developers page][1] and register a new application. All steps are explained in the website. This will get you the `cliend_id` and the `client_secret` values.

To get the access token you need to build the follwing URL:

    https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&redirect_uri=<ANY_URL>&response_type=token

Place your `client_id` in the URL, and a URL to any website (i.e http://google.com).

Copy paste this URL into your browser and log in to Instagram. After this, Instagram will redirect you to the URL you specified, with the access token appended. Copy the token and paste it into your configuration file. And (finally!) you're done.

### Usage

    downstagram <username>

## Development

This project uses `master` branch for development. So if you want to hack on the code, it's suggested that start from a tag commit.
